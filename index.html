            <h2>The Rod</h2>
            <p>The Rod is a very useful teacher that teaches you useful programming stuff and instantly
                regrets it after seeing what his students do with that knowledge. He also teaches game design, which
                kind of makes up for the loss of fun he gets from teaching Sam. As his students progress towards even
                better code, the only instructions he ends up giving them is "make the code in less lines".

            <h2>The Tang</h2>
            <p>The Tang teaches physics at Burnside and loves to come up with the most random quotes. For example:
                "Alex is cancer", which is one that many agree with. As a physics teacher, nobody really cares what he
                says anymore, and nobody is surprised to see he is a very big gamer.</p>

            <h2>The Gibs</h2>
            <p>The Gibs is a supernatural being that has come down from a planet of gods to teach geography at Burnside
                High School. He likes encouraging his students, especially when they call him "bro" gan. Teaching one of
                the most important subjects to understand society, he is very nice to people. We just convinced him to
                start his OnlyFans.</p>

            <h2>The Ris</h2>
            <p>Ris is one of the most underrated Burnside teachers, as he doesn't really let himself stick out. However,
                his students do notice the difference between his teaching style and Dr Smith's, as we actually do
                experiements in his class. As a science teacher, that's pretty epic.</p>
